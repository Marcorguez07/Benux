# Benux
Benux is a program built on python, it simulates how an operating system works, including: Data Management, shell-based commands and program management. The full list of programs available include: Helper, File Explorer, Basic Calculator, Notewriter.

The program it self is "Benux.exe", this executable file can be executed without the need of downloading python. The .py file which is also included in this repository can be used to modify the program as you personally wish. Keep in mind, this is my first python project and ive learned a lot since then, it is not optimized, and matter fact, it needs to be refactored and it will if i ever return to develop the project.
